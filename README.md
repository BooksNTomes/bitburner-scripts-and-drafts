# Bitburner Scripts and Drafts
- A growing compilation of my scripts and annotations on sample scripts used in playing Bitburner and interacting with its APIs.
- This is mainly created for fun and learning.

# Folders
- *sample-scripts-with-annotations* are scripts found in bitburner's in-game documentation or at the bitburner-scripts repository. I will be writing down my thoughts/annotations for sample code I find and will learn from. I will use '!' in my own comments
- *scripts* are scripts I've written, based on what I've learned and sometimes focused what I'm experimenting on. Some of these scripts are more like drafts.
